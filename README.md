# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbital-Overview 
This application is a playground for exploring satellites' orbits and their **ground tracks** on Earth.

---
# üìñ Background
The aim of this application is to track the orbit of a satellite. In order to achieve this goal the application download data of the satellite. The data are in **Two-Line Element (TLE)** format from [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/). TLE data format contains orbital data of an object that orbits around the Earth. For more info about this data check [here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element).

TLE data are use by **Semplified Perturbation Models**, a set of 5 mathematical models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8) used to calculate orbital state vectors of satellites and space debris relative to the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system. For more info about these models check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_perturbations_models).

## ‚ú® Functions (MVP)

- Download satellites' orbital data (TLE)
- Compute the default (ISS) satellite position for a given period
- Visualize a satellite's ground track on a 2D Earth map

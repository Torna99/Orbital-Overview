# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbital-Overview 
This application is a playground for exploring satellites' orbits and their **ground tracks** on Earth.

---

# üìñ Background
The aim of this application is to track the orbit of a satellite. To achieve this, the application downloads the satellite‚Äôs orbital data in the **Two-Line Element (TLE)** format from [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/). A TLE describes the orbital parameters of an object orbiting Earth. For more information about TLEs, see [this reference](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element).
<br><br>
TLE data are used by Simplified Perturbation Models‚Äîa family of five mathematical models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8, and SDP8)‚Äîto compute the orbital state vectors of satellites and space debris in relation to the Earth-centered inertial (ECI) coordinate system. For more details on these models, check [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_perturbations_models).
